# Algorithms of DNA Sequencing in Python (Ongoing project)
This repository contains a collection of scripts, functions, and exercises developed during my progress through the Genomic Data Science Specialization and the Bioinformatics I Honours Track Certification. Furthermore, my solutions to homework from the rosalind bioinformatics platform has also been uploaded. The goal of this work is to build practical proficiency in implementing and debugging genomic algorithms used in computational biology.
## Aim
To efficiently apply fundamental mathematical concepts including combinatorics, set theory and probability to tackle problems in bioinformatics
To gain hands-on experience with core algorithmic techniques in bioinformatics, including sequence analysis, pattern matching, and motif discovery, as part of a structured genomics specialization program.
## Skills and Algorithms Covered
Hamming Distance computation for DNA sequence comparison

k-mer Clump Finding to locate high-frequency regions (e.g., origins of replication)

Boyer-Moore Pattern Matching Algorithm for efficient string search

Motif Detection using the MEME Suite

Use of BioPython for parsing and analyzing biological data
## Coursework & Certification
Completed 10 coding-intensive modules in the Genomic Data Science track

Earned the Bioinformatics I Honors Track Certificate, demonstrating mastery of both theory and applied coding tasks
## Tools & Libraries
Python (3.10+)

BioPython

MEME Suite

Jupyter Notebook (for stepwise development)
## Next Steps
Extend repository with dynamic programming algorithms (e.g., global/local alignment)

Implement basic genome assembly techniques (e.g., De Bruijn graphs)

Apply algorithms to real sequencing datasets (FASTQ/FASTA) using BioPython pipelines.
